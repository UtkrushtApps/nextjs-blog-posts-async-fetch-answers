# Solution Steps

1. Define TypeScript interfaces for individual blog posts (BlogPost) and the API response (BlogApiResponse) to ensure strict typing throughout your component.

2. Implement a mock asynchronous fetchBlogPosts function that simulates an API call (with delay) and returns data matching the interfaces.

3. Inside your BlogHome React functional component, use React's useState to track blog posts (as BlogPost[]), loading (boolean), and error (string|null) states.

4. Use useEffect (with an empty dependency array) to trigger the async API fetch on component mount. Immediately set loading to true and error to null before the fetch.

5. Handle potential race conditions by using a flag (isMounted) to only update state if the component is still mounted when the fetch completes or errors.

6. On success, update state with the fetched posts and set loading to false. On error, set an appropriate error message and set loading to false.

7. Render appropriate UI: show a loading state when loading, an error message if error exists, and the list of blog posts otherwise. Ensure to never render 'undefined' for post fields.

8. Display a message if there are no blog posts to show after loading completes.

9. Ensure only necessary renders and state updates happen by cleanly separating states and by cleaning up async effects with the isMounted flag.
